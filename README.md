#### Introduction to JavaScript  
- JavaScript is the world's most popular high-level programming language.  
- It is an interpreted, dynamically-typed language.  
- Easy to learn, it‚Äôs a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). It is primarily a client-side language.  
- There are also more advanced server-side versions of JavaScript such as Node.  
- It was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995 in 10 days.  
- ECMAScript is the official name of the JavaScript Language.  
- Latest version is ECMAScript 2018.  
- JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:  
  1. **HTML** ‚Üí to define the content of web pages.  
  2. **CSS** ‚Üí to specify the layout of web pages.  
  3. **JavaScript** ‚Üí to program the behavior of web pages.  

#### Environment Setup  
 - We have many tools like VS Code, Atom, Notepad++, Notepad etc., for developing JavaScript based applications using the features like automated suggestions, auto closing tags, function references etc.,
  1. **VS Code**  
  2. **Sublime Text**  
  3. **Komodo Edit**  
  4. **Atom**  
  5. **Brackets**  
  6. **Notepad++**

#### Developer Tools
- Browser has many options to debug the JavaScript applications using developer tools like
  1. **Elements** ‚Üí to find HTML elements.  
  2. **Console** ‚Üí to debug JavaScript console outputs.  
  3. **Sources** ‚Üí to check what are the files involved in the application.
  4. **Network** ‚Üí to check network calls, website loading time etc..
  5. **Performance** ‚Üí to analyze the application overall performance.
  6. **Memory** ‚Üí to check how much data is consuming by browser.
  7. **Application** ‚Üí to store temporary and permanent data and many options like styles filtering, color picker etc.

#### Console
- Console used to debug JavaScript programs line by line
- It has many different types such as warn, error, log etc.,

#### View Source
- We can see the source code of the application using this feature. Press CTRL+U to see the source code or right click on browser and
click on view page source.

#### First JavaScript Program
- JavaScript can be written in 3 different ways: 
  1. Inline Scripting  
  2. Internal Scripting  
  3. External Scripting  
- Let‚Äôs write a simple JavaScript inline scripting program to display Hello World! in webpage.
- Let‚Äôs write light on/off functionality using JavaScript Program.

![Light Bulb Example](week-1/day-1/images/bulb_example.png)

#### Internal Scripts
- If we write JavaScript in a html file with script tag, then we will call it
as internal scripting.
- It usually looks like this <script>....JavaScript code...</script>
- Let‚Äôs write a JavaScript Program Internal Scripting for dark theme and light theme functionality.

![Theme Example](week-1/day-1/images/theme.png)

#### External Scripts
- If we write JavaScript in a separate file with extension .js, then we will call it as **external scripting**.
- Example: Let‚Äôs assume the JavaScript file name is index.js
    ```javascript
        // JavaScript code
        alert("Hello World!");
    ```
- If we include third-party scripts like **jQuery, React, Bootstrap** (via CDN links), which are faster to load, then it is called **third-party scripting**.
- jQuery, React, Bootstrap, Vue, Angular etc., are the frameworks built using JavaScript.
- TypeScript is the sibling to JavaScript which can‚Äôt be executed directly in the browser unless it converts into plain JavaScript, also called as vanilla JavaScript.
- Browser supports only HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT.

#### JavaScript Comments
- Comments are always helpful when we see our code later point of time. It is best practice to use comments at necessary places in JavaScript Programs. Writing more comments are bad practice.
- JavaScript has two types of comments:
    - 1.Single Line comments using doubt slashes
    - Example:
        ```
            //your comment
        ```
    - 2.Mult-line comments using slash star.
    - Example:
        ```
            /* comment
                one more comment
            */
        ```

#### Variables
JavaScript has 4 different types of variables.
  1. **Global Variables**
  2. **`var`**
  3. **`let`**
  4. **`const`**
- Global variables can override the browsers variables, so it‚Äôs not recommended way for creating variables.
- var is also global variable as well as local variable inside a function.
- let and const are having block scope, which means they can‚Äôt be accessed outside the block. For private data, we will use let and const keywords.
- Const cannot be reassigned, it can be modified for reference data types.

#### Async and Defer

#### Data Types in JavaScript
- Data Types are nothing but the kind of data we want to use, such as strings, numbers, objects, arrays, etc.
- JavaScript is **loosely typed** and **dynamically typed**, meaning we can assign any data type to variables and change them at runtime.
- JavaScript has **2 types of data types**:
  1. **Primitive Data Types**
  2. **Reference (Non-Primitive) Data Types**

#### 1. Primitive Data Types
There are **7 primitive data types** in JavaScript:

1. `string`  
2. `number`  
3. `bigint`  
4. `boolean`  
5. `undefined`  
6. `symbol`  
7. `null`  

- Primitive values are **immutable**, which means we can **reassign** values but not **mutate**.

**Example:**
```js
let name = "Venkatesh";
name.toUpperCase(); // We won‚Äôt get the desired output as it won‚Äôt mutate.
name=name.toUpperCase(); // It will give desired output as we are reassigning new value.
```
