#### Introduction to JavaScript  
- JavaScript is the world's most popular high-level programming language.  
- It is an interpreted, dynamically-typed language.  
- Easy to learn, it‚Äôs a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). It is primarily a client-side language.  
- There are also more advanced server-side versions of JavaScript such as Node.  
- It was invented by Brendan Eich in 1995 in 10 days.  
- ECMAScript is the official name of the JavaScript Language.  
- Latest version is ECMAScript 2018.  
- JavaScript is one of the 3 languages all web developers must learn:  
  1. **HTML** ‚Üí to define the content of web pages.  
  2. **CSS** ‚Üí to specify the layout of web pages.  
  3. **JavaScript** ‚Üí to program the behavior of web pages.  

#### Environment Setup  
 - We have many tools like VS Code, Atom, Notepad++, Notepad etc., for developing JavaScript based applications using the features like automated suggestions, auto closing tags, function references etc.,
1. **VS Code**  
2. **Sublime Text**  
3. **Komodo Edit**  
4. **Atom**  
5. **Brackets**  
6. **Notepad++**

#### Developer Tools
- Browser has many options to debug the JavaScript applications using developer tools like
  1. **Elements** ‚Üí to find HTML elements.  
  2. **Console** ‚Üí to debug JavaScript console outputs.  
  3. **Sources** ‚Üí to check what are the files involved in the application.
  4. **Network** ‚Üí to check network calls, website loading time etc..
  5. **Performance** ‚Üí to analyze the application overall performance.
  6. **Memory** ‚Üí to check how much data is consuming by browser.
  7. **Application** ‚Üí to store temporary and permanent data and many options like styles filtering, color picker etc.

#### Console
- Console used to debug JavaScript programs line by line
- It has many different types such as warn, error, log etc.,

#### View Source
- We can see the source code of the application using this feature. Press CTRL+U to see the source code or right click on browser and
click on view page source.

#### First JavaScript Program
- JavaScript can be written in 3 different ways: 
  1. Inline Scripting  
  2. Internal Scripting  
  3. External Scripting  
- Let‚Äôs write a simple JavaScript inline scripting program to display Hello World! in webpage.
- Let‚Äôs write light on/off functionality using JavaScript Program. Here image should come
